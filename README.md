# Thyroid-Cancer-Recurrence-Prediction-A-Machine-Learning-Approach
Thyroid cancer recurrence poses significant challenges in clinical management and patient care. Leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to develop predictive models for thyroid cancer recurrence based on clinicopathologic features,this study explores the potential of machine learning in improving recurrence prediction accuracy.

The project utilizes a diverse set of machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, to predict thyroid cancer recurrence. Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Through comprehensive analysis and visualization of model outcomes, this project seeks to identify the most effective predictive model for thyroid cancer recurrence, ultimately contributing to enhanced patient care and treatment strategies in clinical practice
